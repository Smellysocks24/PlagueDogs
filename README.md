You're free to help me out.



# Description

* You play as Maya a Belgian sheepdog that lives with her owner Evan. As you explore the house you will hear a news channel talking about a breakout of an infection in dogs all over the world. The dogs became aggressive towards other beings.. The infection was caused by a parasyte that attacks the animals nervous system and makes them aggressive. As Maya listens to the news channel a rock breaks the window and Maya escapes the house to look for her owner. Maya will have to fight off numerous infected dogs and make her way to Evan's
 workplace. As you progress through the game Maya will get to eat an infected dog carcass and then get infected herself. Sadly Maya will die at the end and so will her owner.
